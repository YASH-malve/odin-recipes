    <h1>PAV BHAJI</h1>
    <img src="images/pavbhaji.jpg">
    <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
    <p>Pav bhaji is a fast food mostly famous in Maharashtra (mostly Mumbai and Pune). Pav in Marathi means bread and
        bhaji is a term for a curry and vegetable dish. It is usually sold on the carts on the streets. My mom used to
        make this at home, as we don't get it in Andhra Pradesh. This is her recipe which I absolutely adore. You can
        always add any vegetables (like cauliflower, cabbage) that you might have at home. This can be a great meal or a
        light snack. Serve hot with slightly toasted pav or bread.

    <h3>STEPS</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour 2 cups water into the bottom of a pressure cooker. Place a trivet into the pressure cooker and turn the
            heat on high. Add potatoes, carrot, and green peas in a single layer in the pressure cooker and lock the
            lid.

        </li>
        <li>Cook over high heat until the pressure regulator reaches 15 psi, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat. Allow
            pressure to drop naturally, 10 minutes. Unlock and remove lid. Remove vegetables and smash.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, grind ginger-garlic paste and green chile peppers together in a mortar and pestle until well mashed together.</li>
        <li>
            Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat and fry cumin seeds until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add garlic-chili paste and saute for 1 to 2 minutes. Add finely chopped onions and cook until soft and lightly browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Add green pepper, cover, and cook until soft, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes and a little water</li>
        <li>Simmer over low heat until mixture thickens, 5 to 10 minutes. Season with pav bhaji masala and a little chili powder.</li> 
        <li>Stir in boiled smashed vegetables and simmer until flavors meld, about 10 minutes. Season with salt to taste and serve sprinkled with fresh cilantro.</li>   
    </ol>
